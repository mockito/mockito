## How to develop Mockito?

To build locally:

     ./gradlew build

To develop in IntelliJ IDEA you can use built-in Gradle import wizard in IDEA.
Alternatively generate the importable IDEA metadata files using:

     ./gradlew idea

Then, _open_ the generated *.ipr file in IDEA.

## How to release new version?

Mockito [implements Continuous Delivery model](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/Continuous-Delivery-Overview).
Every change on main branch (for example merging a pull request) triggers a release build on Travis CI.
The build publishes new version if specific criteria are met: all tests green, no 'ci skip release' used in commit message, see the build log for more information.
Every new version is published to ["mockito/maven" Bintray repository](https://bintray.com/mockito/maven).
New versions that Mockito team deems "notable" are additionally published to [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.mockito%22) and [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter).
We used to publish every version to Maven Central but we changed this strategy based on feedback from the community ([#911](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/911)).

* Q: What's new in Mockito release model?

  A: In Q2 2017 we implemented [Mockito Continuous Delivery Pipeline 2.0](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/911).
  Not every version is published to Maven Central.

* Q: How to publish to Maven Central?

  A: Include "[ci maven-central-release]" in the **merge** commit when merging the PR.
  **Hint**: To signify a new feature consider updating version to next minor/major, like: "2.8.0", "2.9.0", "3.0.0".

* Q: How to promote already released version to a notable version?

  A: It isn't automated at the moment. [What's the use case?](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/issues/911)
