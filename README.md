## Versioning

Mockito has an automated release system, which imposed some change how the version numbers. While this is similar to [_semver_](http://semver.org/), there's some differences. Let's look at the following versions `1.10.19` and `2.0.5-beta` and `2.0.0` (not yet released) they follow this scheme :

```
major.minor.build-tag
```

| number | meaning                                                                               |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| major  | major version, with most probably incompatible change in API and behavior             |
| minor  | minor version, important enough change to bump this number                            |
| build  | a released build number incremented automatically a pull request is merged            |
| tag    | will probably be `-beta` or just nothing (during beta, breaking changes are expected) |

That means : 
 
 * `2.0.0` and `2.0.5-beta` are binary incompatible with `1.10.19`.
 * `2.0.5-beta` is the fifth release beta of version `2.0.0`.
 * `2.0.5-beta` is a work in progress, api may change and may not be graduated in version `2.0.0`

## Looking for support

* Go to the [mockito mailing-list](http://groups.google.com/group/mockito) (moderated)

## How to build?

To build locally:

     ./gradlew build

To develop in IDE you can use built-in Gradle import wizard in IDEA.
Alternatively generate the importable IDE metadata files using:
