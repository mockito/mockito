## Versioning

Mockito has an automated release system, which imposed some change on how the version numbers work.
The versions follow this scheme:

```
major.minor.patch-tag.tagVersion
```

| number | meaning                                                                               |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| major  | major version, backwards incompatible with the previous major version                 |
| minor  | minor version, backwards compatible with added features                               |
| patch  | patch version, small bug fixes or stylistic improvements                              |
| tag    | *optional* beta or RC (release candidate). See below.                                 |

That means:

* `2.0.0` and `2.0.0-beta.5` are binary incompatible with `1.10.19`.
* `2.0.0-beta.5` is the fifth release beta of version `2.0.0`.
* `2.0.0-beta.5` could be (but is not necessarily) binary incompatible with version `2.0.0`.
* `2.0.0-RC.1` is binary compatible with release `2.0.0`.

**Note : ** During the 2.0 beta phase we unleashed beta builds with the following version schemes, like : `2.0.111-beta`, where the _build number_ is placed beore the _tag_. The current scheme reuses the _build number_ and places it behind the _tag_. Hence those versions are to be considered as beta builds that happen either before or after a release candidate, but always before the final release.

```
2.0.111-beta < 2.0.0-beta.112 < 2.0.0-RC.1 < 2.0.0-beta.200 < 2.0.0
```


### Tags
There are two different tags: beta or RC. Beta indicates that the version is directly generated from the master branch of the git repository.
Beta releases are automatically published whenever we merge a pull request or push a change to the master branch.

When we deem our master status worthy of a release, we publish a release candidate. The release candidate is scheduled to be officially published
in the official release a while later. There will be no breaking changes between a release candidate and its equivalent official release.
The only changes will include bug fixes or small updates. No additional features will be included.

## How to build?

To build locally:

     ./gradlew build

To develop in IntelliJ IDEA you can use built-in Gradle import wizard in IDEA.
Alternatively generate the importable IDEA metadata files using:

     ./gradlew idea

Then, _open_ the generated *.ipr file in IDEA.
