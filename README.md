## Mockito for enterprise

Available as part of the Tidelift Subscription

The maintainers of org.mockito:mockito-core and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver
commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications. Save time,
reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact dependencies you use.

## Development

Mockito publishes every change as a `-SNAPSHOT` version to a public Sonatype repository. Roughly once a month, we
publish a new minor or patch version to Maven Central. For release automation we use Shipkit
library (http://shipkit.org), Gradle Nexus [Publish Plugin](https://github.com/gradle-nexus/publish-plugin).
Fully automated releases are awesome, and you should do that for your libraries, too!
See the [latest release notes](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/releases/)
and [latest documentation](https://javadoc.io/page/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org/mockito/Mockito.html). Docs in
javadoc.io are available 24h after release. Read also
about [semantic versioning in Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/Semantic-Versioning).

Older 1.x and 2.x releases are available in
[Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-core/1.10.19/jar)
and [javadoc.io](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/1.10.19/org/mockito/Mockito.html) (documentation).

## How to develop Mockito?

To build locally:

     ./gradlew build

To develop in IntelliJ IDEA you can use built-in Gradle import wizard in IDEA. Alternatively generate the importable
IDEA metadata files using:

     ./gradlew idea

Then, _open_ the generated *.ipr file in IDEA.

## How to release new version?

1. Every change on the main development branch is released as -SNAPSHOT version to Sonatype snapshot repo
   at https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/mockito/mockito-core.
2. In order to release a non-snapshot version to Maven Central push an annotated tag, for example:

```
git tag -a -m "Release 3.4.5" v3.4.5
git push origin v3.4.5
```

3. At the moment, you **may not create releases from GitHub Web UI**. Doing so will make the CI build fail because the
   CI creates the changelog and posts to GitHub releases. We'll support this in the future.
