<p>
Provides a framework for static code analysis based on the asm.tree package.
</p>

<p>
Basic usage:
</p>

<pre>
ClassReader cr = new ClassReader(bytecode);
ClassNode cn = new ClassNode();
cr.accept(cn, ClassReader.SKIP_DEBUG);

List methods = cn.methods;
for (int i = 0; i < methods.size(); ++i) {
    MethodNode method = (MethodNode) methods.get(i);
    if (method.instructions.size() > 0) {
        Analyzer a = new Analyzer(new BasicInterpreter());
        a.analyze(cn.name, method);
        Frame[] frames = a.getFrames();
        // Elements of the frames arrray now contains info for each instruction 
        // from the analyzed method. BasicInterpreter creates BasicValue, that
        // is using simplified type system that distinguishes the UNINITIALZED, 
        // INT, FLOAT, LONG, DOUBLE, REFERENCE and RETURNADDRESS types.
        ...
    }
}
