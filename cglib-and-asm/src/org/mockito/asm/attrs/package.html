Provides an implementation for optional class, field and method attributes.

<p>

By default ASM strips optional attributes, in order to keep them in
the bytecode that is being readed you should pass an array of required attribute
instances to {@link org.mockito.asm.ClassReader#accept(org.mockito.asm.ClassVisitor, org.mockito.asm.Attribute[], boolean) ClassReader.accept()} method.
In order to add custom attributes to the manually constructed bytecode concrete
subclasses of the {@link org.mockito.asm.Attribute Attribute} can be passed to
the visitAttribute methods of the
{@link org.mockito.asm.ClassVisitor ClassVisitor},
{@link org.mockito.asm.FieldVisitor FieldVisitor} and
{@link org.mockito.asm.MethodVisitor MethodVisitor} interfaces.

@since ASM 1.4.1
