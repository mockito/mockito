/**
 * The facility to create mocks.
 *
 * <p>By default, an internal byte-buddy/asm/objenesis based implementation is used.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code MockMaker} is an extension point that makes it possible to use custom dynamic proxies
 * and avoid using the default byte-buddy/asm/objenesis implementation.
 * For example, the android users can use a MockMaker that can work with Dalvik virtual machine
 * and hence bring Mockito to android apps developers.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Using the extension point</h3>
 *
 * <p>Suppose you wrote an extension to create mocks with some <em>Awesome</em> library, in order to tell
 * Mockito to use it you need to put in your <strong>classpath</strong>:
 * <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
 *     <li>
 *         The implementation itself, for example <code>org.awesome.mockito.AwesomeMockMaker</code> that
 *         extends the <code>MockMaker</code>.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         A file "<code>mockito-extensions/org.mockito.plugins.MockMaker</code>". The content of this file is
 *         exactly a <strong>one</strong> line with the qualified name:
 *         <code>org.awesome.mockito.AwesomeMockMaker</code>.
*      </li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Note that if several <code>mockito-extensions/org.mockito.plugins.MockMaker</code> files exists in the classpath
 * Mockito will only use the first returned by the standard {@link ClassLoader#getResource} mechanism.
