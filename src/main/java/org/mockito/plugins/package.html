Mockito plugins allow customization of behavior.
For example, it is useful for Android integration via dexmaker.
See examples in docs for MockMaker.

<p>
    The plugin mechanism of mockito works in a similar way as the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader}, however instead of
    looking in the <code>META-INF</code> directory, Mockito will look in <code>mockito-extensions</code> directory.
    <em>The reason for that is that Android SDK strips jars from the <code>META-INF</code> directory when creating an APK.</em>
</p>

<p>
    For example :
</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
    <li>
        Create implementation itself, for example <code>org.awesome.mockito.AwesomeMockMaker</code> that extends
        the <code>MockMaker</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        A file "<code>mockito-extensions/org.mockito.plugins.MockMaker</code>". The content of this file is exactly
        a <strong>one</strong> line with the qualified name: <code>org.awesome.mockito.AwesomeMockMaker</code>.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Note that if several <code>mockito-extensions/org.mockito.plugins.MockMaker</code> files exists in the classpath
    Mockito will only use the first returned by the standard <code>ClassLoader.getResource</code> mechanism.
</p>
