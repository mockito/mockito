/**
 * Use it to configure Mockito. For now there are not many configuration options but it may change in future.
 *
 * <p>
 * In most cases you don't really need to configure Mockito. For example in case of working with legacy code,
 * when you might want to have different 'mocking style' this interface might be helpful. 
 * A reason of configuring Mockito might be if you disagree with the {@link org.mockito.Answers#RETURNS_DEFAULTS}
 * unstubbed mocks return.
 *
 * <p>
 * To configure Mockito create exactly <b>org.mockito.configuration.MockitoConfiguration</b> class
 * that implements this interface.
 *
 * <p>
 * Configuring Mockito is completely <b>optional</b> - nothing happens if there isn't any
 * <b>org.mockito.configuration.MockitoConfiguration</b> on the classpath.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>org.mockito.configuration.MockitoConfiguration</b> must implement <code>IMockitoConfiguration</code> or
 * extend {@link DefaultMockitoConfiguration}
 *
 * <p>
 * Mockito will store single instance of <code>org.mockito.configuration.MockitoConfiguration</code>
 * per thread (using <code>ThreadLocal</code>).
 * For sanity of your tests, don't make the implementation stateful.
 *
 * <p>
 * If you have comments on Mockito configuration feature don't hesitate to write to mockito@googlegroups.com.
