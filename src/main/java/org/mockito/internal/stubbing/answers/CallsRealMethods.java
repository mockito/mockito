/**
 * Optional Answer that adds partial mocking support
 * <p>
 * {@link Answer} can be used to define the return values of unstubbed invocations.
 * <p>
 * This implementation can be helpful when working with legacy code.
 * When this implementation is used, unstubbed methods will delegate to the real implementation.
 * This is a way to create a partial mock object that calls real methods by default.
 * <p>
 * As usual you are going to read <b>the partial mock warning</b>:
 * Object oriented programming is more less tackling complexity by dividing the complexity into separate, specific, SRPy objects.
 * How does partial mock fit into this paradigm? Well, it just doesn't...
 * Partial mock usually means that the complexity has been moved to a different method on the same object.
 * In most cases, this is not the way you want to design your application.
 * <p>
 * However, there are rare cases when partial mocks come handy:
 * dealing with code you cannot change easily (3rd party interfaces, interim refactoring of legacy code etc.)
 * However, I wouldn't use partial mocks for new, test-driven & well-designed code.
 * <p>
