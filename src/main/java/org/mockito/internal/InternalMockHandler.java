 * Deprecated, please use {@link MockHandler}.

 * This class was changed in Mockito in order to tidy up Mockito API

 * Since this class is internal, e.g. it resides in "org.mockito.internal" package,
 * Mockito team can change it without the need for major version release of Mockito.
 * <p>
 * This interface was deprecated in Mockito 2.10.0 and will be deleted in Mockito 4.0.
