 * The Mockito library enables mock creation, verification and stubbing.
 * <p>
 * This javadoc content is also available on the <a href="http://mockito.org">http://mockito.org</a> web page.
 * All documentation is kept in javadocs because it guarantees consistency between what's on the web and what's in the source code.
 * It allows access to documentation straight from the IDE even if you work offline.
 * It motivates Mockito developers to keep documentation up-to-date with the code that they write,
 * every day, with every commit.

 *
 * In order to continue improving Mockito and further improve the unit testing experience, we want you to upgrade to 2.0.
 * Mockito follows <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>
 * and contains breaking changes only on major version upgrades.
 * In the lifecycle of a library, breaking changes are necessary
 * to roll out a set of brand new features that alter the existing behavior or even change the API.
 * We hope that you enjoy Mockito 2.0!
 * <p>
 * List of breaking changes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Mockito is decoupled from Hamcrest and custom matchers API has changed, see {@link ArgumentMatcher}
 *     for rationale and migration guide</li>.
 *     <li>Stubbing API has been tweaked to avoid unavoidable compilation warnings that appeared on JDK7+ platform.
 *     This will only affect binary compatibility, compilation compatibility remains unaffected.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * The following examples mock a List, because most people are familiar with the interface (such as the
 * <code>add()</code>, <code>get()</code>, <code>clear()</code> methods). <br>
 * In reality, please don't mock the List class. Use a real instance instead.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * <h3 id="1">1. <a class="meaningful_link" href="#verification">Let's verify some behaviour!</a></h3>
 *
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 * //Let's import Mockito statically so that the code looks clearer
 * import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
 *
 * //mock creation
 * List mockedList = mock(List.class);
 *
 * //using mock object
 * mockedList.add("one");
 * mockedList.clear();
 *
 * //verification
 * verify(mockedList).add("one");
 * verify(mockedList).clear();
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Once created, a mock will remember all interactions. Then you can selectively
 * verify whatever interactions you are interested in.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * <h3 id="2">2. <a class="meaningful_link" href="#stubbing">How about some stubbing?</a></h3>
 *
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 * //You can mock concrete classes, not just interfaces
 * LinkedList mockedList = mock(LinkedList.class);
 *
 * //stubbing
 * when(mockedList.get(0)).thenReturn("first");
 * when(mockedList.get(1)).thenThrow(new RuntimeException());
 *
 * //following prints "first"
 * System.out.println(mockedList.get(0));
 *
 * //following throws runtime exception
 * System.out.println(mockedList.get(1));
 *
 * //following prints "null" because get(999) was not stubbed
 * System.out.println(mockedList.get(999));
 *
 * //Although it is possible to verify a stubbed invocation, usually <b>it's just redundant</b>
 * //If your code cares what get(0) returns, then something else breaks (often even before verify() gets executed).
 * //If your code doesn't care what get(0) returns, then it should not be stubbed. Not convinced? See <a href="http://monkeyisland.pl/2008/04/26/asking-and-telling">here</a>.
 * verify(mockedList).get(0);
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> By default, for all methods that return a value, a mock will return either null, a
 * a primitive/primitive wrapper value, or an empty collection, as appropriate.
 * For example 0 for an int/Integer and false for a boolean/Boolean. </li>
 *
 * <li> Stubbing can be overridden: for example common stubbing can go to
 * fixture setup but the test methods can override it.
 * Please note that overridding stubbing is a potential code smell that points out too much stubbing</li>
 *
 * <li> Once stubbed, the method will always return a stubbed value, regardless
 * of how many times it is called. </li>
 *
 * <li> Last stubbing is more important - when you stubbed the same method with
 * the same arguments many times.
 * Other words: <b>the order of stubbing matters</b> but it is only meaningful rarely,
 * e.g. when stubbing exactly the same method calls or sometimes when argument matchers are used, etc.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 *
 * <h3 id="3">3. <a class="meaningful_link" href="#argument_matchers">Argument matchers</a></h3>
 *
 * Mockito verifies argument values in natural java style: by using an <code>equals()</code> method.
 * Sometimes, when extra flexibility is required then you might use argument matchers:
 *
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 * //stubbing using built-in anyInt() argument matcher
 * when(mockedList.get(anyInt())).thenReturn("element");
 *
 * //stubbing using custom matcher (let's say isValid() returns your own matcher implementation):
 * when(mockedList.contains(argThat(isValid()))).thenReturn("element");
 *
 * //following prints "element"
 * System.out.println(mockedList.get(999));
 *
 * //<b>you can also verify using an argument matcher</b>
 * verify(mockedList).get(anyInt());
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Argument matchers allow flexible verification or stubbing.
 * {@link Matchers Click here to see} more built-in matchers
 * and examples of <b>custom argument matchers / hamcrest matchers</b>.
 * <p>
 * For information solely on <b>custom argument matchers</b> check out javadoc for {@link ArgumentMatcher} class.
 * <p>
 * Be reasonable with using complicated argument matching.
 * The natural matching style using <code>equals()</code> with occasional <code>anyX()</code> matchers tend to give clean & simple tests.
 * Sometimes it's just better to refactor the code to allow <code>equals()</code> matching or even implement <code>equals()</code> method to help out with testing.
 * <p>
 * Also, read <a href="#15">section 15</a> or javadoc for {@link ArgumentCaptor} class.
 * {@link ArgumentCaptor} is a special implementation of an argument matcher that captures argument values for further assertions.
 * <p>
 * <b>Warning on argument matchers:</b>
 * <p>
 * If you are using argument matchers, <b>all arguments</b> have to be provided
 * by matchers.
 * <p>
 The following example shows verification but the same applies to stubbing:
 *
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 *   verify(mock).someMethod(anyInt(), anyString(), <b>eq("third argument")</b>);
 *   //above is correct - eq() is also an argument matcher
 *
 *   verify(mock).someMethod(anyInt(), anyString(), <b>"third argument"</b>);
 *   //above is incorrect - exception will be thrown because third argument is given without an argument matcher.
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Matcher methods like <code>anyObject()</code>, <code>eq()</code> <b>do not</b> return matchers.
 * Internally, they record a matcher on a stack and return a dummy value (usually null).
 * This implementation is due to static type safety imposed by the java compiler.
 * The consequence is that you cannot use <code>anyObject()</code>, <code>eq()</code> methods outside of verified/stubbed method.

 * <code>verifyNoMoreInteractions()</code> is not recommended to use in every test method.
 * <code>verifyNoMoreInteractions()</code> is a handy assertion from the interaction testing toolkit. Use it only when it's relevant.
 * Abusing it leads to <strong>overspecified</strong>, <strong>less maintainable</strong> tests. You can find further reading

 *
 *
 *
 *
 * <h3 id="10">10. <a class="meaningful_link" href="#stubbing_consecutive_calls">Stubbing consecutive calls</a> (iterator-style stubbing)</h3>
 *
 * Sometimes we need to stub with different return value/exception for the same
 * method call. Typical use case could be mocking iterators.
 * Original version of Mockito did not have this feature to promote simple mocking.
 * For example, instead of iterators one could use {@link Iterable} or simply
 * collections. Those offer natural ways of stubbing (e.g. using real
 * collections). In rare scenarios stubbing consecutive calls could be useful,
 * though:
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 * when(mock.someMethod("some arg"))
 *   .thenThrow(new RuntimeException())
 *   .thenReturn("foo");
 *
 * //First call: throws runtime exception:
 * mock.someMethod("some arg");
 *
 * //Second call: prints "foo"
 * System.out.println(mock.someMethod("some arg"));
 *
 * //Any consecutive call: prints "foo" as well (last stubbing wins).
 * System.out.println(mock.someMethod("some arg"));
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * Alternative, shorter version of consecutive stubbing:
 *
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 * when(mock.someMethod("some arg"))
 *   .thenReturn("one", "two", "three");
 * </code></pre>
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * <h3 id="11">11. <a class="meaningful_link" href="#answer_stubs">Stubbing with callbacks</a></h3>
 *
 * Allows stubbing with generic {@link Answer} interface.
 * <p>
 * Yet another controversial feature which was not included in Mockito
 * originally. We recommend simply stubbing with <code>thenReturn()</code> or
 * <code>thenThrow()</code>, which should be enough to test/test-drive
 * any clean & simple code. However, if you do have a need to stub with the generic Answer interface, here is an example:
 *
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 * when(mock.someMethod(anyString())).thenAnswer(new Answer() {
 *     Object answer(InvocationOnMock invocation) {
 *         Object[] args = invocation.getArguments();
 *         Object mock = invocation.getMock();
 *         return "called with arguments: " + args;
 *     }
 * });
 *
 * //the following prints "called with arguments: foo"
 * System.out.println(mock.someMethod("foo"));
 * </code></pre>

 * <code>doAnswer()</code>|<code>doNothing()</code>|<code>doCallRealMethod()</code> family of methods</a></h3>
 *
 * Stubbing void methods requires a different approach from {@link Mockito#when(Object)} because the compiler does not
 * like void methods inside brackets...
 * <p>
 * {@link Mockito#doThrow(Throwable...)} replaced the Mockito#stubVoid(Object) method for stubbing voids in the 1.x version
 * The main reason is improved readability and consistency with the family of <code>doAnswer()</code> methods.
 * <p>
 * Use <code>doThrow()</code> when you want to stub a void method with an exception:
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 *   doThrow(new RuntimeException()).when(mockedList).clear();
 *
 *   //following throws RuntimeException:
 *   mockedList.clear();
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * You can use <code>doThrow()</code>, <code>doAnswer()</code>, <code>doNothing()</code>, <code>doReturn()</code>
 * and <code>doCallRealMethod()</code> in place of the corresponding call with <code>when()</code>, for any method.
 * It is necessary when you
 * <ul>
 *     <li>stub void methods</li>
 *     <li>stub methods on spy objects (see below)</li>
 *     <li>stub the same method more than once, to change the behaviour of a mock in the middle of a test.</li>
 * </ul>
 * but you may prefer to use these methods in place of the alternative with <code>when()</code>, for all of your stubbing calls.
 * <p>
 * Read more about these methods:
 * <p>
 * {@link Mockito#doReturn(Object)}
 * <p>
 * {@link Mockito#doThrow(Throwable...)}

 *
 * <h3 id="13">13. <a class="meaningful_link" href="#spy">Spying on real objects</a></h3>
 *
 * You can create spies of real objects. When you use the spy then the <b>real</b> methods are called
 * (unless a method was stubbed).
 * <p>
 * Real spies should be used <b>carefully and occasionally</b>, for example when dealing with legacy code.
 *
 * <p>
 * Spying on real objects can be associated with "partial mocking" concept.
 * <b>Before the release 1.8</b>, Mockito spies were not real partial mocks.
 * The reason was we thought partial mock is a code smell.
 * At some point we found legitimate use cases for partial mocks
 * (3rd party interfaces, interim refactoring of legacy code, the full article is <a href=
 * "http://monkeyisland.pl/2009/01/13/subclass-and-override-vs-partial-mocking-vs-refactoring"
 * >here</a>)
 * <p>
 *
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 *   List list = new LinkedList();
 *   List spy = spy(list);
 *
 *   //optionally, you can stub out some methods:
 *   when(spy.size()).thenReturn(100);
 *
 *   //using the spy calls <b>*real*</b> methods
 *   spy.add("one");
 *   spy.add("two");
 *
 *   //prints "one" - the first element of a list
 *   System.out.println(spy.get(0));
 *
 *   //size() method was stubbed - 100 is printed
 *   System.out.println(spy.size());
 *
 *   //optionally, you can verify
 *   verify(spy).add("one");
 *   verify(spy).add("two");
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <h4>Important gotcha on spying real objects!</h4>
 * <ol>
 * <li>Sometimes it's impossible or impractical to use {@link Mockito#when(Object)} for stubbing spies.
 * Therefore when using spies please consider <code>doReturn</code>|<code>Answer</code>|<code>Throw()</code> family of
 * methods for stubbing. Example:
 *
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 *   List list = new LinkedList();
 *   List spy = spy(list);
 *
 *   //Impossible: real method is called so spy.get(0) throws IndexOutOfBoundsException (the list is yet empty)
 *   when(spy.get(0)).thenReturn("foo");
 *
 *   //You have to use doReturn() for stubbing
 *   doReturn("foo").when(spy).get(0);
 * </code></pre>
 * </li>
 *
 * <li>Mockito <b>*does not*</b> delegate calls to the passed real instance, instead it actually creates a copy of it.
 * So if you keep the real instance and interact with it, don't expect the spied to be aware of those interaction
 * and their effect on real instance state.
 * The corollary is that when an <b>*unstubbed*</b> method is called <b>*on the spy*</b> but <b>*not on the real instance*</b>,
 * you won't see any effects on the real instance.
 * </li>
 *
 * <li>Watch out for final methods.
 * Mockito doesn't mock final methods so the bottom line is: when you spy on real objects + you try to stub a final method = trouble.
 * Also you won't be able to verify those method as well.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * <h3 id="14">14. Changing <a class="meaningful_link" href="#defaultreturn">default return values of unstubbed invocations</a> (Since 1.7)</h3>
 *
 * You can create a mock with specified strategy for its return values.
 * It's quite an advanced feature and typically you don't need it to write decent tests.
 * However, it can be helpful for working with <b>legacy systems</b>.
 * <p>
 * It is the default answer so it will be used <b>only when you don't</b> stub the method call.

 * <h3 id="15">15. <a class="meaningful_link" href="#captors">Capturing arguments</a> for further assertions (Since 1.8.0)</h3>
 *
 * Mockito verifies argument values in natural java style: by using an <code>equals()</code> method.
 * This is also the recommended way of matching arguments because it makes tests clean & simple.
 * In some situations though, it is helpful to assert on certain arguments after the actual verification.
 * For example:
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 *   ArgumentCaptor&lt;Person&gt; argument = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(Person.class);
 *   verify(mock).doSomething(argument.capture());
 *   assertEquals("John", argument.getValue().getName());
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <b>Warning:</b> it is recommended to use ArgumentCaptor with verification <b>but not</b> with stubbing.
 * Using ArgumentCaptor with stubbing may decrease test readability because captor is created outside of assert (aka verify or 'then') block.
 * Also it may reduce defect localization because if stubbed method was not called then no argument is captured.
 * <p>
 * In a way ArgumentCaptor is related to custom argument matchers (see javadoc for {@link ArgumentMatcher} class).
 * Both techniques can be used for making sure certain arguments where passed to mocks.
 * However, ArgumentCaptor may be a better fit if:
 * <ul>
 * <li>custom argument matcher is not likely to be reused</li>
 * <li>you just need it to assert on argument values to complete verification</li>
 * </ul>
 * Custom argument matchers via {@link ArgumentMatcher} are usually better for stubbing.

 *
 *  Finally, after many internal debates & discussions on the mailing list, partial mock support was added to Mockito.
 *  Previously we considered partial mocks as code smells. However, we found a legitimate use case for partial mocks - more reading:
 *  <a href="http://monkeyisland.pl/2009/01/13/subclass-and-override-vs-partial-mocking-vs-refactoring">here</a>
 *  <p>
 *  <b>Before release 1.8</b> <code>spy()</code> was not producing real partial mocks and it was confusing for some users.
 *  Read more about spying: <a href="#13">here</a> or in javadoc for {@link Mockito#spy(Object)} method.
 *  <p>
 *  <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 *    //you can create partial mock with spy() method:
 *    List list = spy(new LinkedList());
 *
 *    //you can enable partial mock capabilities selectively on mocks:
 *    Foo mock = mock(Foo.class);
 *    //Be sure the real implementation is 'safe'.
 *    //If real implementation throws exceptions or depends on specific state of the object then you're in trouble.
 *    when(mock.someMethod()).thenCallRealMethod();
 *  </code></pre>
 *
 * As usual you are going to read <b>the partial mock warning</b>:
 * Object oriented programming is more less tackling complexity by dividing the complexity into separate, specific, SRPy objects.
 * How does partial mock fit into this paradigm? Well, it just doesn't...
 * Partial mock usually means that the complexity has been moved to a different method on the same object.
 * In most cases, this is not the way you want to design your application.
 * <p>
 * However, there are rare cases when partial mocks come handy:
 * dealing with code you cannot change easily (3rd party interfaces, interim refactoring of legacy code etc.)
 * However, I wouldn't use partial mocks for new, test-driven & well-designed code.

 * <h3 id="17">17. <a class="meaningful_link" href="#resetting_mocks">Resetting mocks</a> (Since 1.8.0)</h3>
 *
 * Smart Mockito users hardly use this feature because they know it could be a sign of poor tests.
 * Normally, you don't need to reset your mocks, just create new mocks for each test method.
 * <p>
 * Instead of <code>reset()</code> please consider writing simple, small and focused test methods over lengthy, over-specified tests.
 * <b>First potential code smell is <code>reset()</code> in the middle of the test method.</b> This probably means you're testing too much.
 * Follow the whisper of your test methods: "Please keep us small & focused on single behavior".
 * There are several threads about it on mockito mailing list.
 * <p>
 * The only reason we added <code>reset()</code> method is to
 * make it possible to work with container-injected mocks.
 * See issue 55 (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/mockito/issues/detail?id=55">here</a>)
 * or FAQ (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/mockito/wiki/FAQ">here</a>).
 * <p>
 * <b>Don't harm yourself.</b> <code>reset()</code> in the middle of the test method is a code smell (you're probably testing too much).
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 *   List mock = mock(List.class);
 *   when(mock.size()).thenReturn(10);
 *   mock.add(1);
 *
 *   reset(mock);

 * In case of questions you may also post to mockito mailing list:

 * <h3 id="19">19. <a class="meaningful_link" href="#bdd_mockito">Aliases for behavior driven development</a> (Since 1.8.0)</h3>
 *
 * Behavior Driven Development style of writing tests uses <b>//given //when //then</b> comments as fundamental parts of your test methods.
 * This is exactly how we write our tests and we warmly encourage you to do so!
 * <p>
 * Start learning about BDD here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development</a>
 * <p>
 * The problem is that current stubbing api with canonical role of <b>when</b> word does not integrate nicely with <b>//given //when //then</b> comments.
 * It's because stubbing belongs to <b>given</b> component of the test and not to the <b>when</b> component of the test.
 * Hence {@link BDDMockito} class introduces an alias so that you stub method calls with {@link BDDMockito#given(Object)} method.
 * Now it really nicely integrates with the <b>given</b> component of a BDD style test!
 * <p>
 * Here is how the test might look like:
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 * import static org.mockito.BDDMockito.*;
 *
 * Seller seller = mock(Seller.class);
 * Shop shop = new Shop(seller);
 *
 * public void shouldBuyBread() throws Exception {
 *   //given
 *   given(seller.askForBread()).willReturn(new Bread());
 *

 *
 * <h3 id="20">20. <a class="meaningful_link" href="#serializable_mocks">Serializable mocks</a> (Since 1.8.1)</h3>
 *
 * Mocks can be made serializable. With this feature you can use a mock in a place that requires dependencies to be serializable.
 * <p>
 * WARNING: This should be rarely used in unit testing.
 * <p>
 * The behaviour was implemented for a specific use case of a BDD spec that had an unreliable external dependency.  This
 * was in a web environment and the objects from the external dependency were being serialized to pass between layers.
 * <p>
 * To create serializable mock use {@link MockSettings#serializable()}:
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 *   List serializableMock = mock(List.class, withSettings().serializable());
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * The mock can be serialized assuming all the normal <a href='http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html'>
 * serialization requirements</a> are met by the class.
 * <p>
 * Making a real object spy serializable is a bit more effort as the spy(...) method does not have an overloaded version
 * which accepts MockSettings. No worries, you will hardly ever use it.
 *
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 * List&lt;Object&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;();
 * List&lt;Object&gt; spy = mock(ArrayList.class, withSettings()

 * <a class="meaningful_link" href="#injectmocks_annotation"><code>&#064;InjectMocks</code></a> (Since 1.8.3)</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * Release 1.8.3 brings new annotations that may be helpful on occasion:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>&#064;{@link Captor} simplifies creation of {@link ArgumentCaptor}
 * - useful when the argument to capture is a nasty generic class and you want to avoid compiler warnings
 * <li>&#064;{@link Spy} - you can use it instead {@link Mockito#spy(Object)}.
 * <li>&#064;{@link InjectMocks} - injects mock or spy fields into tested object automatically.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that &#064;{@link InjectMocks} can also be used in combination with the &#064;{@link Spy} annotation, it means
 * that Mockito will inject mocks into the partial mock under test. This complexity is another good reason why you
 * should only use partial mocks as a last resort. See point 16 about partial mocks.
 *
 * <p>
 * All new annotations are <b>*only*</b> processed on {@link MockitoAnnotations#initMocks(Object)}.
 * Just like for &#064;{@link Mock} annotation you can use the built-in runner: {@link MockitoJUnitRunner} or rule:

 *
 * <h3 id="22">22. <a class="meaningful_link" href="#verification_timeout">Verification with timeout</a> (Since 1.8.5)</h3>
 * <p>
 * Allows verifying with timeout. It causes a verify to wait for a specified period of time for a desired
 * interaction rather than fails immediately if had not already happened. May be useful for testing in concurrent
 * conditions.
 * <p>
 * It feels this feature should be used rarely - figure out a better way of testing your multi-threaded system.
 * <p>
 * Not yet implemented to work with InOrder verification.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * <p>
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">

 *   //passes when someMethod() is called <b>*at least*</b> 2 times within given time span
 *   verify(mock, timeout(100).atLeast(2)).someMethod();

 * <p>
 * Mockito will now allow you to create mocks when stubbing.
 * Basically, it allows to create a stub in one line of code.
 * This can be helpful to keep test code clean.
 * For example, some boring stub can be created & stubbed at field initialization in a test:
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 * public class CarTest {

 *
 * <h3 id="25">25. <a class="meaningful_link" href="#ignore_stubs_verification">Verification ignoring stubs</a> (Since 1.9.0)</h3>
 * <p>
 * Mockito will now allow to ignore stubbing for the sake of verification.
 * Sometimes useful when coupled with <code>verifyNoMoreInteractions()</code> or verification <code>inOrder()</code>.
 * Helps avoiding redundant verification of stubbed calls - typically we're not interested in verifying stubs.
 * <p>
 * <b>Warning</b>, <code>ignoreStubs()</code> might lead to overuse of verifyNoMoreInteractions(ignoreStubs(...));
 * Bear in mind that Mockito does not recommend bombarding every test with <code>verifyNoMoreInteractions()</code>
 * for the reasons outlined in javadoc for {@link Mockito#verifyNoMoreInteractions(Object...)}
 * <p>Some examples:
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 * verify(mock).foo();
 * verify(mockTwo).bar();
 *
 * //ignores all stubbed methods:
 * verifyNoMoreInvocations(ignoreStubs(mock, mockTwo));

 * //creates InOrder that will ignore stubbed
 * InOrder inOrder = inOrder(ignoreStubs(mock, mockTwo));
 * inOrder.verify(mock).foo();
 * inOrder.verify(mockTwo).bar();

 *     Mockito.mockingDetails(someObject).isSpy();
 * </code></pre>
 * Both the {@link MockingDetails#isMock} and {@link MockingDetails#isSpy()} methods return <code>boolean</code>.
 * As a spy is just a different kind of mock, <code>isMock()</code> returns true if the object is a spy.

 * <h3 id="27">27. <a class="meaningful_link" href="#delegating_call_to_real_instance">Delegate calls to real instance</a> (Since 1.9.5)</h3>
 *
 * <p>Useful for spies or partial mocks of objects <strong>that are difficult to mock or spy</strong> using the usual spy API.
 * Since Mockito 1.10.11, the delegate may or may not be of the same type as the mock.
 * If the type is different, a matching method needs to be found on delegate type otherwise an exception is thrown.
 *
 * Possible use cases for this feature:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Final classes but with an interface</li>
 *     <li>Already custom proxied object</li>
 *     <li>Special objects with a finalize method, i.e. to avoid executing it 2 times</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The difference with the regular spy:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     The regular spy ({@link #spy(Object)}) contains <strong>all</strong> state from the spied instance
 *     and the methods are invoked on the spy. The spied instance is only used at mock creation to copy the state from.
 *     If you call a method on a regular spy and it internally calls other methods on this spy, those calls are remembered
 *     for verifications, and they can be effectively stubbed.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     The mock that delegates simply delegates all methods to the delegate.
 *     The delegate is used all the time as methods are delegated onto it.
 *     If you call a method on a mock that delegates and it internally calls other methods on this mock,
 *     those calls are <strong>not</strong> remembered for verifications, stubbing does not have effect on them, too.
 *     Mock that delegates is less powerful than the regular spy but it is useful when the regular spy cannot be created.
 *   </li>

     * <ol>
     * <li>Sometimes it's impossible or impractical to use {@link Mockito#when(Object)} for stubbing spies.
     * Therefore for spies it is recommended to always use <code>doReturn</code>|<code>Answer</code>|<code>Throw()</code>|<code>CallRealMethod</code>
     * family of methods for stubbing. Example:
     *
     * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
     *   List list = new LinkedList();
     *   List spy = spy(list);
     *
     *   //Impossible: real method is called so spy.get(0) throws IndexOutOfBoundsException (the list is yet empty)
     *   when(spy.get(0)).thenReturn("foo");
     *
     *   //You have to use doReturn() for stubbing
     *   doReturn("foo").when(spy).get(0);
     * </code></pre>
     * </li>
     *
     * <li>Mockito <b>*does not*</b> delegate calls to the passed real instance, instead it actually creates a copy of it.
     * So if you keep the real instance and interact with it, don't expect the spied to be aware of those interaction
     * and their effect on real instance state.
     * The corollary is that when an <b>*unstubbed*</b> method is called <b>*on the spy*</b> but <b>*not on the real instance*</b>,
     * you won't see any effects on the real instance.</li>
     *
     * <li>Watch out for final methods.
     * Mockito doesn't mock final methods so the bottom line is: when you spy on real objects + you try to stub a final method = trouble.
     * Also you won't be able to verify those method as well.
     * </li>
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * See examples in javadoc for {@link Mockito} class
     *
     * <p>Note that the spy won't have any annotations of the spied type, because CGLIB won't rewrite them.

     * <p>
     * <b>Warning</b>, <code>ignoreStubs()</code> might lead to overuse of <code>verifyNoMoreInteractions(ignoreStubs(...));</code>
     * Bear in mind that Mockito does not recommend bombarding every test with <code>verifyNoMoreInteractions()</code>

     * Other words: all <b>*stubbed*</b> methods of given mocks are marked <b>*verified*</b> so that they don't get in a way during verifyNoMoreInteractions().
     * <p>
     * This method <b>changes the input mocks</b>! This method returns input mocks just for convenience.

     *  when(mock1.get(0)).thenReturn(10);
     *  when(mock2.get(0)).thenReturn(20);
     *
     *  //using mocks by calling stubbed get(0) methods:
     *  System.out.println(mock1.get(0)); //prints 10
     *  System.out.println(mock2.get(0)); //prints 20
     *
     *  //using mocks by calling clear() methods:
     *  mock1.clear();
     *  mock2.clear();
     *
     *  //verification:
     *  verify(mock1).clear();
     *  verify(mock2).clear();

     * <code>validateMockitoUsage()</code> <b>explicitly validates</b> the framework state to detect invalid use of Mockito.
     * However, this feature is optional <b>because Mockito validates the usage all the time...</b> but there is a gotcha so read on.
     * <p>
     * Examples of incorrect use:
     * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
     * //Oops, thenReturn() part is missing:
     * when(mock.get());
     *
     * //Oops, verified method call is inside verify() where it should be on the outside:
     * verify(mock.execute());
     *
     * //Oops, missing method to verify:
     * verify(mock);
     * </code></pre>
     *
     * Mockito throws exceptions if you misuse it so that you know if your tests are written correctly.
     * The gotcha is that Mockito does the validation <b>next time</b> you use the framework (e.g. next time you verify, stub, call mock etc.).
     * But even though the exception might be thrown in the next test,
     * the exception <b>message contains a navigable stack trace element</b> with location of the defect.
     * Hence you can click and find the place where Mockito was misused.
     * <p>
     * Sometimes though, you might want to validate the framework usage explicitly.
     * For example, one of the users wanted to put <code>validateMockitoUsage()</code> in his <code>&#064;After</code> method
     * so that he knows immediately when he misused Mockito.
     * Without it, he would have known about it not sooner than <b>next time</b> he used the framework.
     * One more benefit of having <code>validateMockitoUsage()</code> in <code>&#064;After</code> is that jUnit runner and rule will always fail in the test method with defect
     * whereas ordinary 'next-time' validation might fail the <b>next</b> test method.
     * But even though JUnit might report next test as red, don't worry about it
     * and just click at navigable stack trace element in the exception message to instantly locate the place where you misused mockito.
     * <p>
     * <b>Both built-in runner: {@link MockitoJUnitRunner} and rule: {@link MockitoRule}</b> do validateMockitoUsage() after each test method.
     * <p>
     * Bear in mind that <b>usually you don't have to <code>validateMockitoUsage()</code></b>
     * and framework validation triggered on next-time basis should be just enough,
     * mainly because of enhanced exception message with clickable location of defect.
     * However, I would recommend validateMockitoUsage() if you already have sufficient test infrastructure
     * (like your own runner or base class for all tests) because adding a special action to <code>&#064;After</code> has zero cost.
