/**
 * Use it to configure Mockito. For now there are not many configuration options but it may change in future.
 * <p>
 * In most cases you don't really need to configure Mockito. For example in case of working with legacy code, 
 * when you might want to have different 'mocking style' this interface might be helpful. 
 * A reason of configuring Mockito might be if you disagree with the {@link ReturnsEmptyValues} unstubbed mocks return.
 * <p>
 * To configure Mockito create exactly <b>org.mockito.configuration.MockitoConfiguration</b> class that implements this interface.
 * <p>
 * Configuring Mockito is completely <b>optional</b> - nothing happens if there isn't any <b>org.mockito.configuration.MockitoConfiguration</b> on the classpath. 
 * <p>
 * <b>org.mockito.configuration.MockitoConfiguration</b> must implement IMockitoConfiguration or extend {@link DefaultMockitoConfiguration}
 * <p>
 * Mockito will store single instance of org.mockito.configuration.MockitoConfiguration per thread (using ThreadLocal). 
 * For sanity of your tests, don't make the implementation stateful.
 * <p>
 * If you have comments on Mockito configuration feature don't hesitate to write to mockito@googlegroups.com
