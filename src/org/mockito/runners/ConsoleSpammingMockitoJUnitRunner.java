/**
 * Uses <b>JUnit 4.5</b> runner {@link BlockJUnit4ClassRunner}.
 * <p>
 * Experimental implementation that suppose to improve tdd/testing experience. 
 * Don't hesitate to send feedback to mockito@googlegroups.com
 * <b>It is very likely it will change in the next version!</b>
 * <p>
 * This runner does exactly what {@link MockitoJUnitRunner} does but also  
 * prints warnings that might be useful. 
 * The point is that Mockito should help the tdd developer to quickly figure out if the test fails for the right reason. 
 * Then the developer can implement the functionality. 
 * Also when the test fails it should be easy to figure out why the test fails. 
 * <p>
 * Sometimes when the test fails, the underlying reason is that stubbed method was called with wrong arguments. 
 * Sometimes it fails because one forgets to stub a method or forgets to call a stubbed method. 
 * All above problems are not immediately obvious.
 * <p>
 * One way of approaching this problem is full-blown 'expect' API. 
 * However it means the 'expectations upfront' business which is not in line with core Mockito concepts.
 * After all, the essence of testing are <b>explicit assertions</b> that are described consistently at the <b>bottom of the test</b> method.
 * <p>
 * Here's the experiment: a warning is printed to the standard output if the test fails.
 * Also, you get a clickabe link to the line of code. You can immediately jump to the place in code where the potential problem is.
 * <p> 
 * Let's say your test fails on assertion. 
 * Let's say the underlying reason is a stubbed method that was called with different arguments:
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 * //test:
 * Dictionary dictionary = new Dictionary(translator);
 * when(translator.translate("Mockito")).thenReturn("cool framework");
 * String translated = dictionary.search("Mockito");
 * assertEquals("cool framework", translated);
 * 
 * //code:
 * public String search(String word) {
 *     ...
 *     return translator.translate("oups");
 *
 * </code></pre>
 * On standard output you'll see something like that:
 * <pre class="code"><code class="java">
 * [Mockito] Warning - stubbed method called with different arguments.
 * Stubbed this way:
 * translator.translate("Mockito");
 * org.dictionary.SmartDictionaryTest.shouldFindTranslation(SmartDictionaryTest.java:27)
 *  
 * But called with different arguments:
 * translator.translate("oups");
 * org.dictionary.SmartDictionary.search(SmartDictionary.java:15)
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>
 * Note that it is just a warning, not an assertion. 
 * The test fails on assertion because it's the assertion's duty to document what the test stands for and what behavior it proves. 
 * Warnings just makes it quicker to figure out if the test fails for the right reason.
 * <p>
 * Note that code links printed to the console are clickable in any decent IDE (e.g. Eclipse).
 * <p>
 * So far I identified 2 cases when warnings are printed:
 * <li>unsued stub</li>
 * <li>stubbed method but called with different arguments</li> 
 * <p>
 * <br/>
 * <p>
